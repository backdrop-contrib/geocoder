Geocoder
========

Geocoder is a module that will extract geographical data (geocode) from
addresses, GPX files, Geotags from EXIF data in photos, and KML files.

Use this module in combination with the Addressfield module
(https://github.com/nbackdrop-contrib/addressfield) and Geofield module
(https://github.com/nbackdrop-contrib/geofield) for a convenient way to get
geo data.

Geocoder uses external geocoding services from Google, Yahoo, and Yandex.

Installation
------------

- Install this module and the required geoPHP module using the official
  Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Install the (optional) common modules Addressfield and Geofield.

- Assign any necessary permissions.

- If you have enabled the modules Addressfield and Geofield you can start using
  Geocoder on a content type.

  - Add a new address field. Go to Administration > Structure > Content types
    (admin/structure/types), choose the desired content type, and select
    "Manage fields".

    - Add a Postal address field and configure the field however you like.

    - Add a Geofield and select "Geocode from another field" as the widget.

      - In the settings for the geofield you can now choose the source field to
        geocode from. You can also choose which geocoding service (Google etc)
        to use and configure the service.

  - Now you have a place where Geocoder can store its result (geofield) and the
    input to the geocode operation (addressfield).
